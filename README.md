# Data-Analyst-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Problem Statement
With the growth of e-commerce websites, people and financial companies rely on online services
to carry out their transactions that have led to an exponential increase in the credit card frauds 
1. Fraudulent credit card transactions lead to a loss of huge amount of money. The design of an effective fraud detection system is necessary in order to reduce the losses incurred by the customers and financial companies
2. Research has been done on many models and methods to
prevent and detect credit card frauds. Some credit card fraud transaction datasets contain the problem of imbalance in datasets. A good fraud detection system should be able to identify the fraud transaction accurately and should make the detection possible in real-time transactions.
### About the Dataset
This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

## Our Goals:
1. Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us.
2.Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. (NearMiss Algorithm)
3. Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
